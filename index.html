                <p>
                    I am self-taught frontend-developer. I have no correspondind working experience in this field, except my personal projects with a links to it in the Code examples section.
                    My previous working experience was connnected with my Academy degree, as an engineer. Also a have a broad experience in working with people: face-to-face and remote also. This experience is related to sales, remote technical support, and working in an aircompany callcenter with english speaking clients.
                    I am a team-player and like to achieve goals with a group of like-minded collegues. I am comminicative and non-conflict person. I think my best parts are peristence and ability to consider the problem from different angles. Due to my english language knowledge, don’t have an issues with technical documentation.
